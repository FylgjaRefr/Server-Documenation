#### Wiki & Documentation
You can find all server information using the wiki, found here: http://wiki.syszee.me/. If you have any questions **DO NOT** ask them in-game, you will simply be directed to the wiki. If you're 100% certain that you've already read through the wiki and just cannot find an answer, then you may ask a community leader.
